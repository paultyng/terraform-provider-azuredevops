# azuredevops_serviceendpoint_permissions

Manages permissions for a Service Endpoint

~> **Note** Permissions can be assigned to group principals and not to single user principals.

## Permission levels

Permission for Service Endpoints within Azure DevOps can be applied on two different levels.
Those levels are reflected by specifying (or omitting) values for the arguments `project_id` and `serviceendpoint_id`.

## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name               = "Sample Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "project-readers" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_serviceendpoint_permissions" "root-permissions" {
  project_id  = azuredevops_project.project.id
  principal   = azuredevops_group.project-readers.id
  permissions = {
    USE               = "allow"
    ADMINISTER        = "allow"
    CREATE            = "allow"
    VIEWAUTHORIZATION = "allow"
    VIEWENDPOINT      = "allow"
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_serviceendpoint_dockerregistry" "dockerhubregistry" {
  project_id             = azuredevops_project.project.id
  service_endpoint_name  = "Sample Docker Hub"

  docker_username        = "sample"
  docker_email           = "email@example.com"
  docker_password        = "12345"
  registry_type          = "DockerHub"
}

resource "azuredevops_serviceendpoint_permissions" "serviceendpoint-permissions" {
  project_id         = azuredevops_project.project.id
  principal          = azuredevops_group.project-readers.id
  serviceendpoint_id = azuredevops_serviceendpoint_dockerregistry.dockerhubregistry.id
  permissions = {
    USE               = "allow"
    ADMINISTER        = "deny"
    CREATE            = "deny"
    VIEWAUTHORIZATION = "allow"
    VIEWENDPOINT      = "allow"
  }
}
```
